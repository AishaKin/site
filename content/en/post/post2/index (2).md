## What was interesting?

1. Passed a few tests and with good results, I'm glad))

2. Sometimes I fast and thanks to that I now communicate with a lot of friends and acquaintances and go to mosque. I like this whole movement

3. I've been praised for my cooking, huh. When it comes to my cooking, it's just a wheel of fortune, it's either okay or it's a mess. And when I get complimented on my food I get super happy that someone likes my crap.


## New Knowledge

- There is always room for development, you can always find new interesting things
